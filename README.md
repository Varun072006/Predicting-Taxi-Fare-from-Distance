# Taxi Fare Prediction Using Linear Regression

# App Link:** 'https://predicting-taxi-fare-from-distance-iqyjshqvjztz68znu9gvyn.streamlit.app/'

## Overview

This project aims to predict taxi fares in a city using a simple linear regression model. By analyzing the relationship between trip distance and fare, we can estimate the cost of a ride and uncover the existence of a base fare (fixed starting charge). This solution is useful for both passengers and taxi operators to ensure transparency and planning.

## Data Description

- **Source:** `Taxi_Fare.csv`
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Distance_km`: Distance of the trip in kilometers
  - `Fare_Rs`: Fare charged for the trip in Indian Rupees (â‚¹)
- The dataset contains real-world taxi ride records.

## Objectives

- Train a linear regression model to predict the fare for a 15 km trip.
- Determine if there is a base fare (fixed cost/intercept) in the pricing.
- Visualize the relationship between distance and fare.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### 2. Run the Analysis

- Open the notebook or Python script.
- The script will:
  - Load the dataset
  - Train the regression model
  - Output the predicted fare for 15 km, base fare, and fare per km
  - Plot the data and regression line

### 3. Example Output

```
Predicted fare for 15 km: â‚¹XXX.XX
Base fare (fixed cost/intercept): â‚¹XXX.XX
Fare per km (slope): â‚¹XX.XX
```

A plot will also be displayed showing the data points, regression line, and the 15 km prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Visualization

The analysis includes a visualization of the data and the regression model:

- Blue dots: Actual taxi rides
- Red line: Regression fit
- Green dot: Predicted fare for 15 km

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how linear regression can be used for fare prediction and pricing analysis in urban transport. The approach is easily extendableâ€”adding more features (like time, weather, or traffic) can further improve prediction accuracy and insights.# Predicting-Taxi-Fare-from-Distance
